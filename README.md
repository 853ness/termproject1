# termproject

git clone (website name) 
  ( this command brings the repo to your terminal, its best you create folder before using this command.)

git add . 
  ( this commands adds all the changes that were made) ( you need the . at the end)

git commit -m “brief message of what was done“ 
  ( this command commits the change that was made, kind of like a final stage for git add.)

git push -u -origin main 
  ( this command pushes everything to GitHub, this should be your very last command that you do.)


if you add or remove anything, you need to add and commit the changes again before pushing the code or else you won't see your changes


-if it asks you to do git config at any point in time do the following commands:
git config --global user.name (your git username)

git config --global user.email (the email you used for git)
